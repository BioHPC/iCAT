High throughput sequencing of immune cell receptorÂ sequences presents a unique opportunity to inform our understanding of immunological response to infection and how we can detect it. However, the nature of this process requires analysis of massive datasets that requires streamlining. Here we present ICAT, an R-based method for tackling this data and applying statistical analyses to find significant patterns and divergences.

# Pre-requisites:

* R version
  * Download R (>3.4.0) version from CRAN.
    * Windows: https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/
    * Mac OS X: https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/
    * Linux: https://cran.r-project.org/bin/linux/

- shiny package

  * install by using the following R command:

        > install.packages("shiny") 

- hash package

  * install by using the following R command:

        > install.packages("hash")  
        
- ggplot2 package

  * install by using the following R command:

        > install.packages("ggplot2") 
        
- data.table package

  * install by using the following R command:

        > install.packages("data.table")  

- dplyr package

  * install by using the following R command:

        > install.packages("dplyr")  

- plyr package

  * install by using the following R command:

        > install.packages("plyr")  

# Download iCAT Package:

* Click the "Clone or download" button located at top-right
* Click "Download ZIP" and extract the compressed ZIP file
* Or you can clone with Git (https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/)


# Run iCAT Package:

* iCAT is implemented as Shiny application. The easiest way to run it is to have RStudio installed and doubl-click on `app.R`. Then, you will be able to hit a `Run App` button at the top toolbar.
